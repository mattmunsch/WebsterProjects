<p>
When I was a young boy (probably too young) I watched Billy Madison and instantly became a fan of Adam Sandler and his comedies.
Over the course of his very long career he has been a part of over a dozen films which I can still find funny time after time.
</p>
<h4>My favorites are:</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Billy Madison
    <li> Happy Gilmore
    <li> The Waterboy
   </ul>

<h3> <center>Video Games

One of my favorite is playing video games. These days I don't have very much time to play, but it is truly relaxing to spend a couple hours at the computer or Xbox mowing down my virtual enemies.
